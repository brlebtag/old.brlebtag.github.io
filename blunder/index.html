                  This tool rocks! It has the potential to completely eliminate that "hair pulling out" needs qualifying Q&amp;A that you go through to figure out if the person really "needs" you at all. 
                  <br>
                  I am way too excited about it. With the answers staring both you and the prospect in the face, you have so much more clarity about "next steps" with a prospects.
